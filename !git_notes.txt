Work process:
git fetch -> git pull -> work -> git add * -> git commit -m "msg" -> git push

Create remote branch:
	git checkout -b <branch-name>
	git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
	                         ^ this is actually <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>,
	                         but if you omit one it asumes both branches have the same name.

Discard all changes made since last commit:
	git checkout .
				^ I think this makes you 'checkout' to the last commit, effectively discarding
				all the changes you made since that. 

Resetting remote to commit:
	git reset --hard <commit-hash>
	git push -f origin master

Delete pushed commits (DO NOT DO IF SOMEONE HAS ALREADY PULLED THE CHANGES):

git reset <previous label or sha1>

	this will re-checkout all the updates locally (so git status will list all updated files)

	then you "do your work" and re-commit your changes (Note: this step is optional)

git commit -am "blabla"

	At this moment your local tree differs from the remote

git push -f
