Work process:
git fetch -> git pull -> work -> git add * -> git commit -m "msg" -> git push

Create remote branch:
	git checkout -b <branch-name>
	git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
	                         ^ this is actually <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>,
	                         but if you omit one it asumes both branches have the same name.

Discard all changes made since last commit:
	git checkout .
				^ I think this makes you 'checkout' to the last commit, effectively discarding
				all the changes you made since that. 

Resetting remote to commit:
	git reset --hard <commit-hash>
	git push -f origin master
