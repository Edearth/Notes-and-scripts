# WARNING! This program is a mockup, a proof of concept, it doesn't really work. 
#
# This is an interpreter for a custom programming language in which you can control the
# flow of the interpreter's cursor in a 2-dimensional grid (the text of the file) with 
# 'directional arrows' characters (>, <, ^, v). The idea is not original, it was inspired
# by fungeoid programming languages (http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fungeoid), p called Befunge ( ), although I haven't really tried it.

# TODO:
# Â· Add multiple threads: with an instruction you could add a new Thread that would interpret
#		the code at the same time as the original thread. Imagine 'spawnThread()' is a function
#		used to spawn a new thread at the second character after the calling of this function.
#		This function would leave the calling thread in the next character after this function
#		and at the same time create a new Thread two characters after the calling. So, take
#		this program as an example:
#
#			> /*code*/ > spawnThread()v> /*thread 2 code*/
#									  > /*thread 1 code*/
#
# 		You could also have them execute the same code simultaneously, as in the following example:
#
#			> /*code*/ > spawnThread()>> /*thread 1 & 2 code*/
#
#		I don't know yet what kind of use this could have, but it would be really cool to
#		make an 'execution viewer' that colors the active threads.
