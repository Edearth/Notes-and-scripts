POSITIVE LOOKAHEAD:
		re(?=gex)		//Will match the  "re" in "regex"

NEGATIVE LOOKAHEAD:
		re(?!gex)		//Will match the  "re" in "reguay"

POSITIVE LOOKBEHIND:
		(?<=re)gex		//Will match the "gex" in "regex"

NEGATIVE LOOKBEHIND:
		(?<!re)gex		//Will match the "gex" in "tirannosaurus gex"

BACKREFERENCE:
		<(.*)>.*</\1>	//Will match a whole XML element like "<h1>asd</h1>".
						//Keep in mind that "<h1>asd</h1></h1>" will alse be matched

DOTALL MODIFIER:
		(?s)			//Using this modifier at the beginning of the expression will
						// allow the dot character (".") to select every character, 
						// including newline characters

NON-GREEDY DOT-STAR:
						//Usually the ".*" in "<h1>.*</h1>" would match from the first
						// <h1> to the last </h1> in this example "<h1>asd</h1></h1>".
		.*?				//Using an interrogation symbol it becomes non-greedy, so it will
						// just match "<h1>asd</h1>" in the last example.

CHARACTER CLASSES:
	Character classes are pretty basic, they let you select any character inside square brackets:
		[A-Za-z0-9]		//This character class will match any letter in upper/lowercase, any
						// one-digit number

	But did you know you can also use negated character classes to match ANYTHING except the
	characters in the class?
		[^0-9]			//This will match anything except a number.

		//This will match from the A to the first B inside that A. For example:
			// using the expression "A:.*B" will match both elements
			// using the expression "A:[^\}]*B" will match the first one
			
			A: [{ /*things inside json file*/ B:'value'}], A: [{ /*things inside json file*/ B:'value'}]

		//You can use this with the dotall modifier in order to mass-replace a JSON file.




CONCRETE EXAMPLES:

	> Line not containing word: 

				^((?!word).)*$
	

	> Select all keys and values inside a json file without quotes (for example, to put the quotes): 

				(?![\s\t])(?<=[:=\[\]{},\s])([^\[\]{}=:,]+)(?=[:=\[{}\],])

			Using group 1 for replacing you can put the quotes in JSON files like this one:

				{transformXmlNode=[{xpath=//Name/First/text(), newValue=NEW NAME}, {xpath=//Name/Last/text(), newValue=LAST NAME}]}

			Replace with:

				"$1" (quotes included)

			Will yield the following result:

				{"transformXmlNode"=[{"xpath"="//Name/First/text()", "newValue"="NEW NAME"}, {"xpath"="//Name/Last/text()", "newValue"="LAST NAME"}]}
