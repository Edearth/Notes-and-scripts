BACKREFERENCE:

DOTALL MODIFIER:
		(?s)			//Using this modifier at the beginning of the expression will
						// allow the dot character (".") to select every character, 
						// including newline characters

CHARACTER CLASSES:
	Character classes are pretty basic, they let you select any character inside square brackets:
		[A-Za-z0-9]		//This character class will match any letter in upper/lowercase, any
						// one-digit number

	But did you know you can also use negated character classes to match ANYTHING except the
	characters in the class?
		[^0-9]			//This will match anything except a number.

		//This will match from the A to the first B inside that A. For example:
			// using the expression "A:.*B" will match both elements
			// using the expression "A:[^\}]*B" will match the first one
			
			A: [{ /*things inside json file*/ B:'value'}], A: [{ /*things inside json file*/ B:'value'}]

		//You can use this with the dotall modifier in order to mass-replace a JSON file.
